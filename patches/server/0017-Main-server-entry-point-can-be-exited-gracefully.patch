Subject: [PATCH] Main server entry point can be exited gracefully

This ends a `Throwable` catching try-clause around the code that follows the main server initialization procedures,
so that if an exception occurs there, it is ignored.
This is so that when the actual server initialization procedure crashes (printing an exception) or fails gracefully
after logging an informative message, it is not followed by an unimportant stack trace (particularly of the post-processing
code failing in some way as a result of the main server initialization having failed). This makes it easier for server
owners to find the information that is relevant to the actual failure, since it will be at the end of the log.

For example, this is relevant when the server initialization fails due to a lack of the confirmation that is made necessary
by the "Require confirming Fiddle permanence" patch.
