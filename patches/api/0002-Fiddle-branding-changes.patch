+Below is the Fiddle Public License Agreement 1.0 (FPL-1.0),
+which applies only to parts of Fiddle that are specifically and
+explicitly released under FPL-1.0.
+
+                FIDDLE PUBLIC LICENSE AGREEMENT
+                    Version 1.0, 29 May 2023
+
+ Copyright (C) 2023 Martijn Muijsers
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+  For pre-existing (typically as part of the Minecraft, Bukkit,
+CraftBukkit, Spigot or Paper source code) files patched with Fiddle
+patches by the Paperweight patch system, any patch hunks that apply to
+those files are licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3
+(GPL-3.0).
+
+  Similarly, any components (such as patch hunks, source files or
+included libraries) in a composite product (such as a repository of
+source code or a jar release file) that is released under this license
+(going forward, to be understood as the Fiddle Public License Agreement
+1.0) as a whole, and which are individually licensed under MIT, GPL-3.0
+or as part of an official Minecraft product (such as the Minecraft server
+source code, which is restrictively licensed as per Microsoft's terms),
+and which are not part of the modificiations made by Fiddle or any
+derivative thereof, are not subject to the further conditions of this
+license, but are instead licensed under their respective original
+licenses.
+
+  For files newly created with Fiddle patches (such as Java source code
+files to merge resource packs), any patch hunks that apply to those files
+are licensed subject to GPL-3.0 with the alterations that follow in this
+license.
+
+1. Share-alike
+
+  Where the GPL-3.0 license would require releasing something (whether
+pertaining to source code, binaries or otherwise) under a license that
+conforms to some particular requirements, such as GPL-3.0, the
+requirement instead becomes to release under this license.
+
+2. Paywalled content must pay-it-forward
+
+  You may not use Fiddle or a derivative thereof to provide a service to
+users, where some features are only available for payment, or more easily
+accessible after some payment than otherwise, except if you clearly
+credit Fiddle and the authors and contributors to the corresponding
+features and their assets, and where possible, pass a fair part (as would
+be considered fair by the community of the receiving parties, or in the
+form of a set amount or ratio as chosen by the author of the features) of
+the revenue on to those parties.
+  As an example, if you install a free pack that adds content, but only
+allow donators to use some parts of that content, then you must donate
+a fair part of the donations to that pack's authors and Fiddle.
+
+3. Prohibition on re-selling the server jar
+
+  Fiddle or derivatives thereof, including any resulting server jar, do
+not require having their source code shared just for running them as a
+Minecraft server, similar to GPL-3.0.
+  This means, that as a server owner, you may make additional custom
+modifications to the Fiddle source code, and use the resulting server jar
+as your Minecraft server.
+
+  However, distribution of Fiddle or derivatives thereof, including
+any resulting server jar, is not allowed to be conditional, whether
+financial or otherwise, to any extent.
+  For example, as a server host you are not allowed to place any
+conditions on server owners to use Fiddle or a derivative, compared to
+the corresponding upstream or an alternative (such as Paper or Fabric) or
+provide any cheaper or less conditional package at all that does not
+support Fiddle, but supports an upstream or alternative thereof.
+  Providing access to the functionality of Fiddle or derivatives thereof
+in any way, whether directly or indirectly, that is not directed at an
+end user Minecraft client, is considered distribution.
+  Additionally, any such distribution of a Fiddle derivative that is not
+directed at an end user Minecraft client requires the full source code of
+the additional modifications in the modified version (as defined by
+GPL-3.0) to be pre-emptively, publicly (specifically, as a public
+repository on GitHub) released under the Fiddle Public License Agreement
+1.0, and a reference to that release must be clearly displayed to all
+intermediate users (such as server owners) and end users (such as
+Minecraft clients).
+  For example, distributing a derivative of Fiddle that contains
+performance enhancements requires the full source code for the
+modifications to be pre-emptively, publicly released.
