Thanks for using Fiddle!

Fiddle is still not finished. Maybe things that you would like are missing.
If you would like to add or change something, feel free to make the desired changes and send in a PR.
Of course, you can also make suggestions in Discord, although you may have to rely on someone actually implementing it.

### Code style

Generally, stick to the same style as Paper:
* Changes to Minecraft/Paper files should have a `Fiddle - <module name> - <reason for this code change>` comment
* To stay agile, we try to keep changes to Minecraft/Paper files to a minimum where possible
* Packages act like small separate modules: their purpose is briefly described in their `package-info.java`.
