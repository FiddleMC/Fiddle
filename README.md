## Goals of the project

### Work for any client

The blocks and items can be used by anyone.
* Players with a corresponding client mod receive the custom blocks and items directly.
* Players with a resource pack can see the custom blocks and items through a collection of replaced block and item and entity models.
* Anyone without the resource pack sees the closest vanilla equivalent, with the custom item's name as display name.

### Can be seamlessly updated

Mods adding custom blocks frequently have the problem that they stop being updated, or need to be updated for every version, which makes it hard for servers to use them. The custom blocks added to a Fiddle server are updated automatically, and remain saved in the world and placeable/breakable as before.

### Works with plugins

Custom blocks and items work fully with almost all plugins out of the box.
