## Introduction

Fiddle is a Paper server fork that lets you add new blocks and items into Minecraft.

Fiddle:
* works with (existing) Bukkit plugins[^1]
* adds blocks and items into the game in the same way a Minecraft update would
* works with the vanilla client, both with/without a resource pack, and also offers a client-side mod with extra performance
* modded blocks and items keep working after Minecraft updates
* adding new blocks and items is simple using the standard resource and data pack format
* allows Bukkit plugins to include custom blocks and items when used on a Fiddle server

## Installation

Fiddle is a drop-in replacement for Paper.\
You can download the latest stable JAR from [releases](https://github.com/FiddleMC/Fiddle/releases) and the latest development JAR from [actions](https://github.com/FiddleMC/Fiddle/actions).

After running Fiddle once, you must open `fiddle.txt`, read the warning carefully, and set `modded=true`.

[^1]: Some older plugins have still not updated to use 1.13+ namespaced ids. These plugins can still be used on Fiddle, but require having [backwards compatibility mode](https://github.com/FiddleMC/Fiddle/wiki/Plugin-compatibility#backwards-compatibility) enabled.

## Adding blocks/items

Modded blocks and items are defined in a pack (similar to a resource or data pack). 
You can download packs made by others, or [create your own packs](https://github.com/FiddleMC/Fiddle/wiki/Making-packs) and share them.

A pack is a `.zip` or `.rar` file. Packs can be placed in the `fiddle_packs` folder in the server root.\
*Example location:* `fiddle_packs/WillowTrees.zip`

Bukkit plugins can also include custom blocks and items when used on a Fiddle server.

## Demo

An experimental version of Fiddle is already running on a small community server.
You can join *sucraft.org* and do `/warp Demo` to see it in action yourself.



You are very welcome to join the project by adding code parts, testing, sharing knowledge or giving suggestions.

## Goals of the project

### Supports any player

* A client mod that supports the custom blocks and items directly
* A resource pack that allows vanilla clients to see the custom blocks and items
* Players do not have to accept the resource pack, and will be shown custom blocks and items as closely as possible

### Seamless updates

Mods adding custom blocks frequently have the problem that they break with a new Minecraft version, and then sometimes stop being updated.

The blocks and items added to a Fiddle server do not need to be updated, and always remain saved in the world and loadable, placeable and breakable as before.

### Works with plugins

Custom blocks and items work fully with Bukkit plugins out of the box.
