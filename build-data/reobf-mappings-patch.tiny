# We would like for paperweight to generate 100% perfect reobf mappings (and deobf mappings for that matter).
# But unfortunately it's not quite there yet - and it may be some time before that happens. Generating perfect mappings
# from Spigot's mappings is extremely difficult due to Spigot's bad tooling and bad mappings. To add insult to injury
# we remap Spigot's _source code_ which is a lot more complex and error-prone than bytecode remapping. So with all that
# said, this file exists to help fill in the gap.
#
# We will continue to improve paperweight and will work on fixing these issues so they don't come up in the first place,
# but these mappings exist to prevent these issues from holding everything else in Paper up while we work through all
# of these issues. Due to the complex nature of mappings generation and the debugging difficulty involved it may take
# a significant amount of time for us to track down every possible issue, so this file will likely be around and in
# use - at least in some capacity - for a long time.
#
# If you are adding mappings patches which are correcting for issues in paperweight's reobf mappings generation,
# unrelated to any changes in your patches, we ask that you PR the mapping to Paper so more users can benefit rather
# than keep the fix for your own fork. If the mappings patch is there to correct reobf for changes made in your patches,
# then obviously it doesn't make any sense to PR them upstream.
